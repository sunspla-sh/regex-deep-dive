# Notes

A series of personal notes as I learn regular expressions in-depth.

## What is a Regex?

A *regular expression*, or "*regex*" for short, is a text string that describes patterns to find text or positions within a body of text.

They are often used for accomplishing tasks such as
   - finding text within a larger body of text
   - validating that a string conforms to a desired format
   - replacing or inserting text at matched positions
   - splitting strings

## What is a Regex Engine?

A *regex engine* is the program that accomplishes the task of evaluating a given regular expression and then finding the associated matches within some string or text.

*(**Nota Bene**: For anyone reading this without previous programming experience, a "string" is a data type in computer programming with the primary purpose of storing human-readable text, like words and sentences. Whenever you see the term "string" in these notes, you can assume that it is referring to a sequence of some letters of one or more alphabets, numbers, common puncuation symbols (like a period or semi-colon), or any combination of those together. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) for more info.)*
